'''Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

# you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
# print("this is a debug message")

def solution(A):
    # write your code in Python 3.6
    k=0 # posled element
    #l=[]
    l=set()
    for x in A:
        if x>0:
            if x==k+1:
                k=x
                while k+1 in l:
                    l.remove(k+1)
                    k=k+1
            else:
                l.add(x)

    return int(k+1)
    pass

#A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2]
#print (solution(A))
